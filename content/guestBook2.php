Our dog was very welcome and had some lovely walks by the lake. We just loved how peaceful it was and not far from local attractions. So pleased to have found this gem in our favourite holiday destination.&quot;

                <p class="text-justify">&quot;We would highly recommend Meadow Green Farm to anyone looking for a lovely week or two away. Beautiful quiet country location, within easy reach of the beach and town at Saundersfoot. The hospitality of the owners was second to none. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful. We, as a family of 4, (2 adults, 2 girls - 17 and 15 years) stayed in the Cornflower Cottage, which was perfect for us.&quot;

                <p class="text-justify">The picture of the house doesn't really do justice to the lovely private setting. This house is round the back and detached from the other two holiday cottages. The small group of buildings have been thoughtfully landscaped to give everyone their privacy. On site there was a children's area which would have been lovely when the kids were smaller. Made us feel nostalgic. There were fields all around the property and yet it was a stroll (or short drive with beach kit!) into town. Inside, Meadowsweet is fully kitted out and spotlessly clean. The Wi-Fi was good and secure (our teens appreciated that) and the beds were comfortable. Fluffy towels galore, and general essentials in both kitchen and bathroom to get you started on a wonderfully relaxed holiday. Wonderful welcome from Alan and Gwen. Thank you so much.&quot;

                    &quot;We love visiting Saundersfoot but this cottage is the best we’ve stayed in by far. Just minutes from Saundersfoot sea front. Great walks from Saundersfoot over to Stepaside, great pub at Wisemans Bridge, to stop off for a drink/food or just to sit and take in the wonderful views. We also took a drive out to Barafundle Bay, so worth a visit stunning. Golden sands and Crystal-clear waters. Only booked a 4 night stay, so wished I’d booked a week now. Thank you all for a lovely stay.&quot;

                          &quot;Hi, well what can I say; from the minute we got here we all loved it, even Benji our dog. The cottage is beautiful;
                          everything you could possibly need.
                          Thank you Rob for cooking us some lovely food. Brian's 60th, we all made is special for him.
                          We will be back later on this year. Love Storer family xxx&quot;

                          &quot;Had a great few days in October in Cornflower Cottage.
                          We were made to feel so welcome and the cottage was so cosy and comfortable.
                          Didn't manage to sample Rob's cooking which is obviously very popular from the comments in the visitors book but will hopefully get the opportunity next time!&quot;
