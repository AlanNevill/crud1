                          &quot;We love visiting Saundersfoot but this cottage is the best we’ve stayed in by far. Just minutes from Saundersfoot sea front. Great walks from Saundersfoot over to Stepaside, great pub at Wisemans Bridge, to stop off for a drink/food or just to sit and take in the wonderful views. We also took a drive out to Barafundle Bay, so worth a visit stunning. Golden sands and Crystal-clear waters. Only booked a 4 night stay, so wished I’d booked a week now. Thank you all for a lovely stay.&quot;

                          &quot;We were recommended to come to the cottage by our cousin who came last
                          year, and indeed came back at the same time as us. The cottage and peaceful
                          location are lovely and the hospitality is wonderful. We were told not to
                          bring much for the children as everything would be here for them and that
                          was true! the children hardly played with any of their own toys! They loved
                          playing with Maisie aswell. Great holiday and would love to come back again.&quot;

                          &quot;Hi, well what can I say; from the minute we got here we all loved it, even Benji our dog. The cottage is beautiful;
                          everything you could possibly need.
                          Thank you Rob for cooking us some lovely food. Brian's 60th, we all made is special for him.
                          We will be back later on this year. Love Storer family xxx&quot;

                          &quot;Had a great few days in October in Cornflower Cottage.
                          We were made to feel so welcome and the cottage was so cosy and comfortable.
                          Didn't manage to sample Rob's cooking which is obviously very popular from the comments in the visitors book but will hopefully get the opportunity next time!&quot;
